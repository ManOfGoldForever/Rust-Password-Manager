# Contributing to pm 🦀

First, thanks for your interest in contributing to "pm"! Contributions are what make open-source so amazing.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Check the Issues tab to make sure the bug hasn't already been reported
- If it has not, open an issue with the label `bug` and describe the problem, your operating system, and steps to reproduce the bug.

### Suggesting Features

- Open an issue with the label `enhancement`.
- Describe the feature you'd like to see and why it would be useful. (e.g., "Add a cli to improve user experience").

### Pull Requests (Code Contributions)

- If you've fixed a bug, added a new feature, or even just fixed a README typo, you can submit a pull request with your changes.
- Make sure the code is easy to read and understand, include tests for new features or bug fixes and they all pass, and follow the Rust Style Guide (You can use the `cargo fmt` command to make sure it fits the style guide.)
- Also since this is a Rust project you will need the standard toolchain to run cargo commands like `cargo build`.

## Security Note

If you find a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue and instead contact me directly so it can be fixed without being disclosed.
